    <p>There are many different foods that dogs can eat, but there are indeed some that can be very dangerous to all types of dogs. Here, we will discuss the types of human foods a dog can and cannot eat and why.</p><br><br><br>
    <h1>Foods Dogs CAN Eat</h1>
    <img src="coconut.png" alt="coconut" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Coconut: This funky fruit contains Lauric, which strengthens the immune system by fighting off viruses. It can also help with bad breath and clearing up skin conditions like hot spots, flea allergies, and itchy skin. Coconut milk and coconut oil are safe for dogs too.</p><br><br>
    <img src="eggs.png" alt="eggs" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Eggs: Eggs are safe for dogs as long as they are fully cooked. Cooked eggs are a wonderful source of protein and can help an upset stomach. However, eating raw egg whites can give dogs biotin deficiency, so be sure to cook the eggs all the way through before giving them to your pet.</p><br><br>
    <img src="tuna.png" alt="tuna" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Tuna: In moderation, cooked, fresh tuna is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which promotes heart and eye health.</p><br><br>
    <img src="fish.png" alt="fish" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Fish:  Fish contains good fats and amino acids, giving your dog a nice health boost. Salmon and sardines are especially beneficial – salmon because it’s loaded with vitamins and protein, and sardines because they have soft, digestible bones for extra calcium. With the exception of sardines, be sure to pick out all the tiny bones, which can be tedious but is definitely necessary. Never feed your dog uncooked or under-cooked fish, only fully cooked and cooled, and limit your dog’s fish intake to no more than twice a week.</p><br><br>
    <img src="yogurt.png" alt="yogurt" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Yogurt: Plain yogurt is a perfectly acceptable snack for dogs, however some canines may have trouble digesting it. If your dog can digest it, the active bacteria in yogurt can help strengthen the digestive system with probiotics.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h1>Foods Dogs CANNOT Eat</h1>
     <img src="chocolate.png" alt="chocolate" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p> Chocolate: Chocolate contains very toxic substances called methylxanthines, which are stimulants that stop a dog’s metabolic process. Even just a little bit of chocolate, especially dark chocolate, can cause diarrhea and vomiting. A large amount can cause seizures, irregular heart function, and even death.</p><br><br>
    <img src="cinnamon.png" alt="cinnamon" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Cinnamon: Cinnamon and its oils can irritate the inside of dogs’ mouths, making them uncomfortable and sick. It can lower a dog’s blood sugar too much and can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, increased, or decreased heart rate, and even liver disease. If they inhale it in powder form, cinnamon can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and choking.</p><br><br>
    <img src="macadamianuts.png" alt="macadamia nuts" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Macadamia nuts: These are some of the most poisonous foods for dogs. Macadamia nuts, part of the Protaceae family, can cause vomiting, increased body temperature, inability to walk, and lethargy. Even worse, they can affect the nervous system.</p><br><br>
    <img src="icecream.png" alt="icecream" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Icecream: Canines don’t digest dairy very well, and many even have a slight intolerance to lactose, a sugar found in milk products.</p><br><br>
    <img src="garlic.png" alt="garlic" style="display: block; margin-right: auto"/> <p>Garlic: Like onions, leeks, and chives, garlic is part of the Allium family, and it is five times more toxic to dogs than the rest of the Allium plants. Garlic can create anemia in dogs, causing side effects such as pale gums, elevated heart rate, weakness, and collapsing. Poisoning from garlic and onions may have delayed symptoms, so if you think your dog may have eaten some, monitor him or her for a few days, not just right after consumption.</p>
